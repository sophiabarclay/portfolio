        <p>Hello, thank you for stopping by!</p>
        <p>I am a recent graduate from General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development course, currently looking for my first role as a web developer.<br><br> Having previously worked in communications in the Chinese consumer market as well as international hospitality sector, I hope to bring the skills acquired in my previous jobs as well as the knowledge gained over the previous months of learning to a role in a collaborative team of developers, in an environment where I can continue to grow and broaden my skills.</p>

          <h4>Placeholder</h4>
          <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> 1 week</p>
          <p class="">This was my fourth and final project during the WDI course at General Assembly (full time 12-week immersive). For this project, I paired up with one of my classmates to create Placeholder, an architecture mapping app, where users can pin their favourite buildings to a map, follow like-minded users and discover other architectural gems by location on a map of the world. Users can also create 'tours' by grouping buildings into curated collections, with the ability to add a description and receive comments.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>My third project at General Assembly was a collaborative three-person effort to build a fully RESTful gig listing app, allowing venues to upload upcoming events to an open platform which users can then search for and click to attend. We used MongoDB, Node.js & Express to build the server-side API, and AngularJS to build the front-end that consumes our API.</p>

          <p>SQUARES was designed for my first project at General Assembly, and was my first solo attempt at using JavaScript. The game is loosely based on the same concept as Pac-Man, whereby the player (white) must cover all of the red squares while avoiding the randomly moving grey squares, or 'ghosts'</p>
          <p>If the player collides with a ghost they are given the option to start again, and if they succeed in covering all of the red squares, they are given the option to play the second level.</p>
